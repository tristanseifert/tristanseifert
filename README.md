## Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile.
Here you will find pretty much every single personal project I've started (and for the most part, abandoned) over the past few years. See pinned repositories for stuff I'm actively working on.

- 🧑‍💻 I'm interested in operating systems and embedded development, with a focus on security.
- 🌎 Check out [my blog](https://blraaz.me) to see what I'm currently working on.
- 📬 You can contact me [via email.](mailto:tristan@tseifert.me)
- 🗄 Some of my projects can also be found [on GitLab](https://gitlab.trist.network/tseifert) and associated [documentation here.](https://bookstack.trist.network)
